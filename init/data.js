      "The Nalanda University Ruins are situated about 3 km from the Nalanda Railway Station and approximately 14 km from Rajgir, in the Nalanda district of Bihar. The site covers a vast area between historical manmade lakes and beautifully maintained gardens, making it both a historic and scenic location.",
      story:"The ruins of Nalanda University present an extensive archaeological site that showcases the remains of one of ancient India’s greatest centers of learning. Spread over an area of around 23 hectares, the site comprises the remains of monasteries (Viharas), temples (Chaityas), lecture halls, dormitories of monks and students, stupas, stairways, sculpted panels, and more. One of its most remarkable features is the Sariputra Stupa, built by Emperor Ashoka. Nalanda flourished as a prominent Buddhist monastic university drawing scholars from various parts of Asia. The site’s architectural layout with red-brick structures, multiple levels, and intricate ornamentation provides visitors with a sense of the grandeur and scholarly atmosphere that once dominated the university. Founded in the 5th century CE, Nalanda remained a beacon of education and Buddhist philosophy for over 800 years. It housed over 2,000 teachers and 10,000 students at its peak, offering studies in theology, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and logic. The university became famous far beyond India, attracting scholars from China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, and Central Asia. Built primarily under Gupta and later Pala dynasties, Nalanda was repeatedly expanded and renovated until its destruction during the 12th–13th centuries. Its sacking by invaders marked the decline of Buddhist learning in India. The site was excavated and protected by the Archaeological Survey of India in the early 20th century and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016.",
